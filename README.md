# traffic_sign_interiit

Dataset.py has the initial python code containing the TrafficDataset class which has augmentations like random crop and resize, color jitter, Gaussian blur, sharpening, random affine.
The desired dimensions of the image (height, width), desired augmentations need to be given as an input apart from the images and labels.

Several parameters like alpha, beta, gamma, delta have been used in this code which will be read from a configuration file generated by the UI.
